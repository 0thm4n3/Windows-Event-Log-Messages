Guidance:
When a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot, the volume snapshot driver scans for and activates any persistent snapshots that may be on the volume.  This process took longer than the amount of time allowed on this system, so activation has been aborted.  Unless the volume is in snapshot protection mode, all snapshots on this volume have been deleted.">

Guidance:
When a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot, the volume snapshot driver scans for and activates any persistent snapshots that may be on the volume.  This process attempts to determine whether the volume is part of a cluster shared resource, but the query to determine this failed.

This error does not indicate that any snapshots have been deleted.  You should expect this event if the volume is on a dynamic disk or is managed by a third-party volume manager.">
